# Chorus ðŸŽµ  
*Turn noisy feedback into clear themes.*

---

## Problem  
PMs and product teams are flooded with customer feedback from Slack threads, support tickets, and survey forms.  
But raw feedback is messy. It takes hours to sift through and spot patterns â€” slowing down decisions and hiding the real signal.  

---

## Solution  
**Chorus** takes raw, unstructured feedback and harmonizes it into 3â€“5 clear themes.  
For each theme, you get:  
- A **1-sentence summary**  
- **Example quotes** pulled from the feedback  
- Copyable output you can drop into your PRD, slide deck, or Notion doc  

Paste in the feedback â†’ see the chorus emerge.

## How It Works  
1. **Input**: Paste raw user feedback (multiple lines of text).  
2. **Process**: AI clusters feedback into themes.  
3. **Output**: Clean cards with a theme title, summary, and supporting quotes.
